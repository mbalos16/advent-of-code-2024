# Advent of Code
This repository is dedicated to my solutions for the 2024 Advent of Code challenges. Advent of Code is not just an event; it is a remarkable opportunity where thousands of coders unite to assist Santa Claus in delivering joy to children around the world on time. If you seek to learn more about this inspiring project or wish to join us, please visit the official website: https://adventofcode.com/2024/about.

This advent begins on December 1st and culminates on the 25th, offering a new challenge each day with 2 problems that increase in complexity over time. Every correct solution earns you a star, totaling 50 stars to be won.

To inspire my friends to embark on this adventure, I've created a private leaderboard where the aim is to complete all the problems. If youâ€™re excited to join this journey, please send me a private message, and I'll share the leaderboard code with you.

Happy coding!
